### Gwangju [uprising][3]
When the Canadian K-Pop artist, Cha Sanggu [spoke of][2] [Gwangju uprising][1], I thought it is not appropriate word selection, because I thought that the word, upriging has a negative connotation. However, according to Wikipedia, it seems that it is widely used word. I got confused, because it is traslated into 폭동, 반란 or 봉기 in Korean. They all are negative meaning. So, rather than calling it as an uprising, a [democratic movement][4] would be better choice for this historical event.

### given
As a preposition, it has meaning of **take into account**. In Korean, it is translated into ~을 고려했을 때, 어쩌고 어쩌고. More sample sentence will help me understand and get accustomed with it.

<div class="sample-sentence">
Given the complexity of the task, they were able to do a good job.
