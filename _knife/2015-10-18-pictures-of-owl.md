# [This cute tiny owl is too photogenic!][1]

Which one is better to express about the above article?

 1. By looking at the pictures, I found out that owls are so cute creatures.
 2. Through those pictures in the above link, I've realized that owls are so cute.

I can't tell because I honestly have no idea about that.


I saw a reply that I found it expresses very well about the writer's thought.

```
They look so cute, every time i see pictures of owls i think awww i wish i could keep one.. and then i remember that one time when i was younger my father rescued one, he was injured and we kept him until he got better.. that wild creature was ready to eat your fingers whenever you were tying to feed him. And of course when his wing started to heal he/she was shitting all over place. But still i felt sad to take him back to forest.
