> **I have injured my knee** very recently and feel I need to be seen by an **orthopaedic surgeon** ASAP, what should I do?

The first thing **anyone wanting to see an orthopaedic surgeon** needs to do is visit their GP. The GP will assess the injury and carry out early tests required such as x-rays. The GP will then decide on the next step. If they feel you need to see an orthopaedic surgeon you will be provided with **a referral letter.** Dr McAuliffe will **arrange to see** any urgent injuries as quickly as possible in **the case where early intervention will be beneficial**. In order to arrange this Dr McAuliffes requests that you drop in or fax (38120444) your referral into the rooms and Dr McAuliffe will review it and we will contact you with an appointment time. Alternatively your GP may decide to call Dr McAuliffe and discuss this with him.
