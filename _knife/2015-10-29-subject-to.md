### be subjected to(verb)

Interestingly and confusingly, subject can be used as a noun, an adjective, or a verb. This subject is recognized as verb and it has a meaning of 'to cause someone to undergo an experience'. So in this passive form, the meaning will be 'forced to undergo an experience'. In general, it has a negative connotaion. However, it can be used in a pleasant or neutral experience.

<div class="sample-sentence">
	<p>Sadly, immigrants are subjected to verbal and emotional abuse in many parts of the country</p>
	<p>Emperor Penguins are subjected to the severe cold of Antartic winters.</p>
</div>
