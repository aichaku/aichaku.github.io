### [deteroirate][1]

become worse.<br/>
글쓰기에 사용하면 좋을 표현으로 보인다. 구어에서도 사용하는 것을 이미 라디오에서 들었으니 get worse같은 표현 대용으로 사용해도 좋겠다.

> She was taken into ​hospital last ​week when her ​condition ​suddenly deteriorated.

> The ​political ​situation in the ​region has deteriorated ​rapidly.


### [social character][3]
사회적으로 나타나는 특성을 가리키는 말로 보인다. 주로 <strong>social character of something</strong>과 같은 식으로 쓰이는 것을 볼 수 있다.

[Big data and the social character of genes][2]
> A new study at the University of Haifa has used "big data" analytical methods to reveal the "social character" of genes -- a phenomenon in certain diseases whereby genes operate jointly rather than independently.

이렇게..


### fortunate enough to convince them
I was fortunate enough to convince them.<br/>
이런 표현이 입에 익을 때까지 반복하는 것이 필요하다. 스피킹할 때 자주 쓸 수 있는 표현인 듯.

```
Here is the sentence I want to use: "If we are fortunate enough to win your business, then." Do I say fortunate enough of just fortunate? [출처][4]
```

이 질문에 대한 답변은 아래와 같다.<br/>
In your example, I think you would want to say "fortunate enough." Saying, "If we are fortunate to win your business" does not sound right. You need to include the adverb "enough" in this sentence so that people know how you are being fortunate. If you do not wish to use "enough," you could say, "If we are so fortunate as to win your business," but you need to use something other than just "fortunate" by itself.

왜 그럴까?
