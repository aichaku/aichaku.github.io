### [portray][1]
As per Google, it means that:
 * depict (someone or something) in a work of art or literature.
 * (of an actor) represent or play the part of (someone) on film or stage.
 * describe (someone or something) in a particular way.

Anyhow, the word is used to reveal something in a prticular way.

	<p>The ​writer portrays ​life in a ​small ​village at the ​turn of the ​century.</p>
	<p>The ​father in the ​film is portrayed as a ​fairly ​unpleasant ​character.</p>
