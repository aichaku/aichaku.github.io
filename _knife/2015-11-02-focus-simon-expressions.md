### Come my way
This phrase just means "happen to me".
'나에게 일어나는, 생기는' 등으로 해석할 수 있으나 상황에 맞게 의미를 조금 바꾸어야 하는 경우도 생기는 것 같다.

<div class="sample-sentence">
    <p>I'll accept anything that comes my way</p>
</div>

This line can be substituted by the following.

<div class="sample-sentence">
    <p>I'll accept anything happens to me</p>
</div>

###### come one's way
to come into one's possession (of objects) or to become available, as an opportunity; as, good things will come your way.


### hope for something
to be optimistic that one's wish for something will come true. I still hope for her return. We hope for good weather on Friday.
그냥 기대를 하는 것이 아니라 긍정적인 무언가를 희마한다는 것을 염두해둬야 한다.

    <p>Hoping for some help to come his way</p>
</div>
