I think the best word to describe the weather in my country would be changeable. The British weather is very unpredictable. One day you can get glorious sunshine then the next day you might get hailstones and freezing wind. Even in the middle of summer, you can never rely on getting good weather, as anybody who has organised an outdoor event in this country will know. Every year on the news we see pop festivals that turn into muddy swamps due to heavy rain or summer holidays at the seaside ruined by terrible weather. But having said that, when the sun does decide to shine in this country, I could not think of better place to be. One thing that I like about the British weather is that we don't really get extremes of temperature as some other countries do.


The rain does sometimes get me down especially if it continues for weeks without stopping and it often makes me feel reluctant to leave the house. I'd say that my favourite season of the year is spring because ater a long cold winter the first signs of spring really lift my spirits. When we have a heatwave in the summe, which sometimes can be for weeks on end, I love to go down to the coast where you can cool off in the sea or just enjoy the cool breeze coming off the sea.


In the winter I tend to be stay indoors as mush as possible because I hate the cold weather. I think having four very different seasons, as we do in the UK, is a good thing because  it's amazing to see how the countryside changes with the seasons. I think I would find it very strange to live near the equator where the weather is pretty the same all the year round.
