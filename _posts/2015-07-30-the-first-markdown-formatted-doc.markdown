title: Angelina Jolie of the incredibly hot software developers

I watched an episode of The American sitcom, How I Met Your Mother. In that episode, Barney, one of the main characters introduced him as Angelia Jolie of incredibly hot guys. Inspired by his line, I decided to use "Angelina Jolie" in this post.
