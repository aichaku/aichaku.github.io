### Tree Traversal
A tree traversal refers to a specific order in which to trace the nodes of a tree.
There are 3 common tree traversals

1. in-order traversal
  * left, root, right
  * This traversal shows sorted sequence of nodes.
2. pre-order traversal
  * root, left, right
  * When you want to duplicate a tree, you can use this traversal.
3. post-order traversal
  * left, right, root
  * This is the depth-first approach. So we can use this traversal when we free the memories assigned to nodes.
