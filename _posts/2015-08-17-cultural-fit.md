Frankly speaking, my friends were worried about me when I informed them of the news that I would work for my current company. Their concerns were totally understandable, because I seemed not to fit in this kind of large corporation.

Today I read an article about cultural fit and that made me think about my colleagues. They all have similar personalities and attitudes towards a certain issue. In fact, I am trying to stand out of the tendency, because that has influenced me in a negative way. I am not going to tell the similarity is harmful. However, if I am put under the circumstance that diversity is not appreciated, I feel like I am killing my creativity.

Actually, cultural fit is very important matter. However, I agree with that as long as it positively contribute to an individual and an organization.
